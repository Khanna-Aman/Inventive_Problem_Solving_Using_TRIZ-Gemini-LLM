  "problem_title": "Zero-Latency Hazard Detection for L5 Autonomous Vehicles",
  "domain": "Autonomous Vehicle Engineering / AI Safety Systems",
  "current_situation": {
    "description": "Current L4/L5 vehicles rely on massive sensor fusion (LiDAR, Radar, Cameras) to build a 3D world model. They prioritize 'caution' over 'intuition,' often resulting in phantom braking or paralysis in complex scenarios (e.g., heavy snow, erratic human behavior).",
    "technical_limitations": "Increasing safety currently requires adding more sensors and heavier compute units. This increases latency (processing time), power consumption, and vehicle cost, making mass adoption difficult."
  },
  "ideal_final_result": {
    "description": "The vehicle inherently detects and avoids all hazards instantly, in any weather condition, without requiring expensive sensor upgrades or supercomputers.",
    "constraints": [
      "Must not increase the vehicle's production cost",
      "Must operate with <10ms latency",
      "Must function without reliance on 5G/Cloud connectivity (fully offline)",
      "Must not drain the EV battery significantly"
    ]
